Chronic wound care is a significant health and economic challenge around the world. Unlike many other diseases, chronic wounds can be significantly mitigated through active monitoring. While various techniques exist, the scarcity of extensive and diverse training datasets limit the development and validation of machine learning frameworks. 

In this work we introduce **Syn3DWound**, an openly available dataset featuring high-fidelity simulated wounds complete with 2D and 3D annotations. We introduce baseline methods and a benchmarking framework aimed at automating 3D morphometry analysis and 2D/3D wound segmentation.
